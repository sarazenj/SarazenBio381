Batch Processing

1) Repeat the exercise from the Batch Processing Lecture (7th April), but do it using real data sets rather than purely simulated. Check with folks in your lab to see if there are multiple data sets available for analysis. Stick to simple data analyses and graphics, but try to set it up as a batch process that will work on multiple files and save summary results to a common file.

I have a for loop code that I had help with writing, so I am going to edit it here and try to use batch processing, functions, and the coding skills we learned to improve it.

The pasting at the top of the graphs isn't the best, but I still get the information that I want - the min and max flow rates, and the whole code works.

```{r}

#set the working directory to the folder you want
setwd("/Users/Jill/Desktop/BIO 381/SarazenBio381/ISCOS")
#list the files in that folder, just to check that we got the right place
list.files("/ISCOS")

#Get a list of all your ISCO names in the folder
isco_names <- unique(substr(list.files(),1,2))
print(isco_names)

# creating functions to use in the loop

# ---------------------------------------------
# FUNCTION: flow_rate_range
# description: calculate max flow rate during storm subset
# inputs: file that is cut down to each storm event
# outputs: a max flow rate value in L/s

flow_rate_range <- function(x) {

maxval <- max(x)
minval <- min(x)

min_max <- c(maxval, minval)

} # end of max_flow

# FUNCTION plot_hyrograph
